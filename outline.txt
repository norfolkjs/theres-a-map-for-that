1. Intro

  - Why?
    - growing sub-field: intersection of CS and GIS
    - new technologies

  - Web + Map = Google Maps?
    - kind of basically-ish true; Google sure wants you to think that
    - has both technical and legal limitations
      - legal: TOS
      - technical: Projections, Functions

  - Conflationary Dichotomies
    - geocoding vs. reverse-geocoding
    - longitude vs. latitude
    - Cartography vs. Geography
    - geometry vs. geography

1. Sans Javascript

  - CartoDB

  - Mapbox
    - geojson.io

  - Yay!
    - Great for building maps
    - Not as great for consumption

2. With Javascript and GeoJSON

  - "Custom" backend with PostGIS + Geoserver
    - custom, as in, not Google. 
    - allows you to ask non-trivial questions of your data
  
  - "Custom" frontend with Leaflet.js + others
    - custom, as in, not Google.
    - quotation marks, because user experience can remain common

  - Rapid Prototype Example

3. Weatherblur.com Example
